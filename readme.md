## Explanation:
The YAML file defines three services: 
1. hostapd 
2. dnsmasq
3. mosquitto

hostapd is used to create the WiFi access point. It uses the linuxserver/hostapd image and mounts a custom hostapd.conf file for configuration.
dnsmasq is used for DNS and DHCP services. It uses the linuxserver/dnsmasq image and mounts a custom dnsmasq.conf file for configuration.
mosquitto is the MQTT broker service. It uses the eclipse-mosquitto:2 image and exposes port 1883 for MQTT connections. It also mounts a custom mosquitto.conf file and a persistent data volume for storing MQTT data.


## Setup:
- Install Docker and Docker Compose on your Raspberry Pi.
    `sudo apt-get install docker-compose`
- Create the configuration files (hostapd.conf, dnsmasq.conf, and mosquitto.conf) in the same directory as the Docker Compose YAML file.
- Replace your_password with your desired WiFi password in hostapd.conf.
- Replace YourAccessPointName with your desired WiFi access point name in hostapd.conf.
- Run docker-compose up -d to start the services in detached mode.
- Configure your devices to connect to the WiFi access point.
- Use an MQTT client to connect to the Mosquitto broker at tcp://192.168.1.1:1883.
